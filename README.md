# Function and Recursion - Java Solutions

This project contains Java solutions to problems involving functions and recursion. The code implements recursive algorithms to solve common problems like finding the minimum value in an array, calculating factorials, checking for primes, and more. Each problem has an interactive terminal input for easy testing.

## Problems Solved

1. **Minimum value in an array** - Finds the minimum number from an array of integers.
2. **Average of array elements** - Calculates the average of all elements in an array.
3. **Prime number check** - Determines if a given number is prime.
4. **Factorial calculation** - Computes the factorial of a number using recursion.
5. **Fibonacci sequence calculation** - Calculates the nth Fibonacci number.
6. **Power function** - Computes the result of raising a number to a given power.
7. **Reversing an array using recursion** - Reverses the elements of an array without using additional arrays.
8. **Check if a string consists only of digits** - Determines if a string contains only numeric digits.
